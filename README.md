# Sketch API
This repository downloads data from **sketches** on **Khan Academy** (votes, forks, code, comments, ...). The data **can be simply accessed from any KA program**. 

## Versions

|1            |First version, can load main, forks, feedbacks (without comments) and questions of a program.            |YES              |

## Setup
To setup this API for your project, go here: **COMING SOON** <br>
Find a thread, that says `>>> Here send your program IDs <<<`. Send there this comment: 
```
<YOUR_PROGRAM_ID>
```
*Note*: Replace `YOUR_PROGRAM_ID` with your program id :) <br><br><br>
After doing that, the API will start logging data of your program. <br>
*Note*: It might take up to 10 minutes. 

## First steps
Let's begin using the API! 
 1. Create a new webpage on Khan Academy. 
 2. Add `<script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Infinite-Coder-001/Sketch-API@[VERSION]/main.js"></script>` to the `<head>`. <br>
    *Note*: Replace `[VERSION]` with the version, that you want to use. 
 3. Add an empty paragraph to `<body>` with id `demo`. 
 4. Add a `<script>` to the `<body>` and use the API! 
 
**Example**: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Sketch API example</title>
        <script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Infinite-Coder-001/Sketch-API@1/main.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p id = "demo"></p>
        <script>
            function callback(data) {
                var element = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = data.code;
            }
            SketchAPIMain(5234045946740736, callback);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```
